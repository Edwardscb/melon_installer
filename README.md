## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Edwardscb/melon_installer
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd melon-installer
npm install
```

3. **Build the installer**

```bash
npm run build
```

4. **Move Installer**

The installer will be in the dist folder, move the installer to a desired location and use it. It should guide you through the process. After it is installed, you can run the app or find the desktop icon (windows) and run it that way.
